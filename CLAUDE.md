## Overview

MCP multiplexer CLI with lazy toolset loading. Aggregates multiple MCP servers, loads tool definitions on demand, and provides an interactive Claude chat interface. Node.js runtime, bundled with tsup, published as `@spike-land-ai/spike-cli`.

## Commands

```bash
npm run build        # Bundle with tsup
npm test             # Run tests (Vitest)
npm run test:coverage # Tests with coverage
npm run typecheck    # tsc --noEmit
npm run lint         # ESLint
```

```

**Key pattern**: The multiplexer discovers MCP servers from a registry, lazily loads their tool schemas, and presents a unified tool surface to AI clients.

## Code Quality Rules

- Never use `any` type — use `unknown` or proper types
- Never add `eslint-disable` or `@ts-ignore` comments
- TypeScript strict mode
- All business logic must have test coverage

## CI/CD

- Shared workflow: `.github/.github/workflows/ci-publish.yml`
- Changesets for versioning
- Publishes to GitHub Packages (`@spike-land-ai/*`)
